## [Aerospace-Predictive-Maintenance](https://github.com/alok2244/Aerospace-Predictive-Maintenance)
Predictive Maintenance techniques are used to determine the condition of an equipment to plan the maintenance/failure ahead of its time. This is very useful as the equipment downtime cost can be reduced significantly.

The objective of this project is to implement various Predictive Maintenance methods and assess the performance of each. Each method can be classified broadly into two categories.

> Classification: Predicting the failure of machine in upcoming n days <br/>
> Regression: Predicting the remaining useful life of a machine.

## [Flight-Price-Prediction](https://github.com/alok2244/Flight-Price-Prediction)
Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumerâ€™s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements. In this project we simulate various models for computing expected future prices and classifying whether this is the best time to buy the ticket.
